At the Wireless and Sensing Image (WSI) Laboratory at SRM University, our main emphasis is on the state-of-the-art development in the area of wireless communications and sensing technologies. Their work is organized around various, albeit interconnected aspects, such as reconfigurable reflect arrays (RRA) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), where they create meta surfaces to improve wireless networks utilizing beamforming, polarization manipulation, and energy-efficient communication. We investigate unconventional metasurface geometries and RF design as well as material characteristics and electromagnetic engineering for practical applications including polarization transformation and wave absorbance. We also specialize in Radar and millimeter wave Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensing and imaging that provides high resolution images and detection of various objects for remote sensing, surveillance, and environment monitoring applications. In addition, we add the RF equipment and imaging sensors to the drones to expand their functionalities for hunting, remote sensing, and communication tasks with AI-based optimization for effective use in areas like disaster management and smart agriculture practices. By means of AI/ML algorithms, we improve the performance of wireless communication systems, RF systems, and radar imaging to the cutting edge of technologies and offer modern solutions.
